   *
   * This is a simple style sheet used to number spec assertions.  The
   * user should leave the id elements empty when hand editing a spec
   * assertion document.  They can then transform their spec document
   * using this stylesheet.  Nested assertions are also handled by this
   * stylesheet.
   *   Example:
   *     If the user has a spec document for the technology area JAXRPC,
   *     top level asertion id elements will be filled in with
   *     "<id>JAXRPC:SPEC:[number]</id>"  where number is the number
   *     of this assertion in reference to all other top level assertions.
   *     If users have nested assertions the IDs will contain a nested id
   *     element similar to:
   *     "<id>JAXRPC:SPEC:[number_parent].[number]</id>" where number_parent
   *     is the number of the parent assertion.  This numbering scheme
   *     will be applied to all levels of sub-assertions.  For instance, if
   *     assertion 1 has a sub-assertion that also has a sub-assertion.
   *     The asigned ID will be:
   *     "<id>JAXRPC:SPEC:1.1.1</id>"
   *
   * To run the stylesheet on a specification assertion document cd to
   * $CTS_TOOLS_WS/tools/xsl-transformer/scripts
   * execute the run script and pass the xml file, the stylesheet, and
   * an optional output file (if no output file is specified the results
   * are written to standard output).  Example:
   *
   *   run xml_file xsl_stylesheet [output_file]
